# mediacollection
Simple data display/management for physical and digital music, video (movies/tv), books, and games collections

# first things first
If you will be using this on a public server, put the /cgi-bin/media/media.pl file within a separate directory that is password protected so that only you can add/amend/delete your database entries.<br>
Aside from editing the "#!/usr/bin/perl" line at the top of each script, things *should* work "directly out of the box." 

# demonstration
A demonstration of the script and it's abilities is online and available, with editing abilities enabled. No password is required for the admin side. Test it out as you wish, http://rgarfinkel.heliohost.org/cgi-bin/mediademo/index.cgi.<br>
Please note that the "modification" date in the shown/hidden HTML on the demonstration sites may be newer than the one present here on Github. I do the coding offline on a local server, post it to the public site to verify it still works on there, then I'll post it here.

# requirements
For this script to run, you'll need to have a web server and it needs to be capable of running Perl scripts. It can be a public server or just a local server.<br>
I use Aprelium's Abyss Web Server for local server scripting/testing, free and available for Windows/Mac/Linux; http://aprelium.com/. Perl installation instructions are here: http://aprelium.com/abyssws/perl.html.<br>
The public server I use for the demonstration (as well as my other sites there) is also free; http://heliohost.org. Highly suggest signing up with the Stevie server if you go with this option, the Johnny server isn't quite as good in terms of reliability. Stevie has daily signup limits, and the clock resets at midnight UTC (http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/timezone/utc). You do need to remember to login to your account once a month to keep your account activeâ€“I can say comfortably that your account and all files will be recovered if you do forget.

# what is included
- /javascripts/gs_sortable.js, http://www.allmyscripts.com/Table_Sort/index.html: allows for the dynamic sorting of table headers (only accessible when page has not been scrolled down)<br>
- /javascripts/jquery-1.5.1.min.js, http://jquery.com/, http://sizzlejs.com/: disabled, required for use of freezeheader below<br>
- /javascripts/jquery.freezeheader.js, http://brentmuir.com/projects/freezeheader: disabled because it's unreliable in operation. freezes table header at the top of the screen when scrolling down

# items of note
- When using the <b>&</b> ampersand symbol in text fields, the editing feature didn't work. It seems that the 'query string' parsing splits this like it is a separate entry. Text replacement will occur server side, swapping the <b>&</b> symbol for <b>(amp)</b> text.
- When using the <b>"</b> double quotation symbol in text fields, the editing feature didn't work. When clicking an entry to edit, the browser would interpret the quotations as the end of an <b>A HREF</b> HTML tag. Text replacement will occur server side, swapping the <b>"</b> double quotation mark for <b>''</b> two single quotation symbols for storing the entries, and <b>''</b> two single quotation symbols will be swapped for the <b>"</b> double quotation mark for display in the user facing tables.
- When using the <b>#</b> pound symbol in text fields, the editing feature didn't work. I think what happens is the script thinks that the entry is supposed to be hidden, like it is a comment in Perl. When a pound sign is needed in titles, use <b>(pound)</b>, and it will be entered into the database that way, and <b>(pound)</b> will be swapped for <b>#</b> pound symbol in the user facing tables.
- When using the <b>+</b> plus symbol, the editing feature works, but not as expected. The plus symbol is the indicator that forms use for spaces, and would be interpreted as such. When the <b>+</b> plus symbol is to be used within a text field, use <b>(plus)</b>. This will be entered into the database, and <b>(plus)</b> will be swapped for <b>+</b> plus symbol in the user facing tables.
- When movies are redone and the titles are the same, you'll get unwanted results when trying to edit one of the two entries. For example, the 1967 movie, *The Jungle Book* and the 2016 movie, *The Jungle Book*. When both exist in the database, both entries would be edited when editing one of the entries. To work around this, there is now a year input box within the media editor for videos, and entries are now compared by title and year, when the year has a value.
- The columns currently within each media section are the media types that I have. As an example, I don't have a Sony Playstation 1, 3, or 4 system/games, so those columns don't exist yet in the games section. If you need these or other options, file an issue here on Github, and I'll add whatever you need, or if anyone wants to contribute, that's okay too.

# things to add/research
- Make code comments on files and processes for helping others' understand what is doing what. (media.pl is close to finished, index.cgi will be next)
- Work on the wiki for this project.
- EAC/UPC/ISBN approval script to verify that public entries are at a good quality.
- Ability to hide/show columns, ie if there are media types that you don't personally have/use. This will require a slight revamp of code, but will make additions of media types easier in the future. Currently column numbers are adjusted manually by myself, so when a column is added, I have to manually increment a variable number by one. The method I've come up with will essentially automate that. This will not require adjustments to the database files, either.
- Researching other options for having a fixed header upon scrolling. The one that was in place is not 100% reliable.<br>

# things to add way down the road<br>
- TheAudioDB.com, imdb.com, themoviedb.org, thetvdb.com, musicbrainz.org and/or thegamesdb.net integration would be awesome, but I don't know enough about API usage currently to do these, hopefully someone can step up with these abilities.
- Hosted website with these scripts put online, with member signup abilities.

# change log
- 2016.10.25
  - 2016.10.20 update had some variable naming adjustments that I missed, now fixed with this update.
- 2016.10.20
  - There's now a EAC/UPC/ISBN entry verification/editing option, it compares each media type's database of entries with EAC/UPC/ISBN values against their EAC/UPC/ISBN entries; individual cells are highlighted cells green if they match, or red if they don't match. It's not necessarily a bad thing if they don't match, of course. It's limited only to what is in your database, it doesn't open each EAC/UPC/ISBN entry within each directory, at least, not yet.
  - Made naming adjustments to the variables, subroutines and links, ie 'debug' is now 'config'.
  - Media edits now 'POST' data to the script, so edits are generally unlimited in length.
  - The header of the admin pages is now two lines in height, so I spread out the links a bit.
  - The automatic switch of the <b>+</b> plus symbol worked well at times, but I found that it also caused issues, for example, typing the apostrophe would be replaced with <b>(plus)</b> as well, for whatever reason; you'll have to do this manually now.
- 2016.10.07
  - When adding entries, it will be sorted into the database.
  - $basedir is now automatically discovered by the scripts.
  - (amp) can now be used so that the ampersand symbol appears in the user facing tables.
  - Some code cleanup and optimizing.
- 2016.10.05
  - Added ability for new/editing titles to have the ability to swap the <b>+</b> plus symbol for <b>(plus)</b> automatically upon entry by the user.
  - EAC/UPC barcodes are strictly numbers. If anything else is entered, it is stripped server-side.
  - ISBN barcodes are strictly numbers and the upper/lowercase letter 'X'. If anything else is entered, it is stripped server-side, and 'x' will be capitalized.
- 2016.10.01
  - When items have specific symbols, they don't always make it through to the text title, for example, Ed Sheeran's album, "+", because the script interprets the plus symbol as a space. In this case, you can't use the plus symbol directly in the title, and it can't be automatically swapped, at least server side- I'd like to find a way to swap these prior to submitting using JavaScript client side. Currently, the only workaround is to use <b>(plus)</b> instead.
  - The <b>#</b> pound symbol is another case, and it seems this is because Perl interprets it as a comment within the script, and it breaks the editing ability. The <b>#</b> pound symbol will be automatically swapped for <b>(pound)</b> server side.
  - Found an error in the code on the admin side where the month was lost on date updated entry, now fixed.
  - Table display on non-admin side is now centered, and also contains the github mention footer.
- 2016.09.19
  - Up until now, when EAC/UPC/ISBN codes were found, the entry was overwritten upon each edit. Now entries are only created and not updated/overwritten.
  - Added a year input option to videos on the administration side, and also added the display of the year on the non-administrative side. I now have two movies that were named the same, and editing one would edit the other. This is now fixed, as long as one or both of the movies have a year attached to it.
- 2016.09.16
  - Some code cleanup/rearranging.
  - Added the ability to sort the table columns in the administration pages.
  - In the 'debug' menu, there's now an option for sorting titles with "The" at the beginning, and this effects both the non-administration and administration side. Using *The Sandlot* as an example, when 'sort by' is on, the title will appear as, *Sandlot, The*. Otherwise, it will appear as *The Sandlot*. For adding/changing *The Sandlot*, you can enter *Sandlot, The* or *The Sandlot*, and it will be entered into the database as *Sandlot, The* server side.
  - Added descriptions for the functions of each option in the 'debug' menu.
  - If I add more options on the 'debug' menu, I may switch the name to be 'options' instead.
  - While testing the sorting in the administration side, the media collection totals would sometimes also be included in the sort. To prevent this from happening now, those totals now appear separate of the sortable table.
  - When you first visited the non-administration page, there would be no 'dotype' variable passed to the administration page, if you clicked on the admin link. This would result in the administration page displaying only the text, "missing 'dotype'." This is now fixed, and shows the headers as well.
- 2016.09.09
  - Added the ability to add items based on ISBN codes or EAC/UPC barcodes! I haven't found a "universal" barcode service that can provide DVD/BluRay/CD/Movie/TV/Books barcodes, so I built one into the script. At the center of the top of the administration pages, there's now the option to add items based on ISBN and EAC/UPC barcodes. The only text input available there are either the ISBN or EAC/UPC barcode textbox. If the code is not found, you'll be directed to add it manually. Upon submitting the manual entry, the entry is created within the 'upc' or 'eacupc' folders that contains the items' EAC/UPC code, ISBN code, title, artist(s)/author(s), database type, and physical media type. I've started these folders with my collections of ISBN/UPC/EAC codes, hopefully more people can contribute theirs as well.
  - When adding entries, the first text box in the editing screen receives focus so you can start typing right away, rather than clicking first then typing.
- 2016.09.08
  - In the video section, BluRay and DVD columns are now combined into one, which will allow for adding more media types in the future, if needed (ie. VHS, LaserDisc, HD-DVD, etc. if it is requested). There is a "transfer" script that is in the cgi-bin/media folder that will combine the BluRay and DVD entries into one entry, run it only once.
- 2016.09.07
  - Forced width of title column on non-admin and admin pages
  - Changed color of row highlight to a darker color
  - Put UPC/ISBN closer to the left side, where appropriate on the different media types. some were on the left, others on the right
  - Turned off "fixed header" on the non-admin page; sometimes the header stayed fixed, other times not, and would sometimes not be scaled with the columns below
